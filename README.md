# Example HTTP upload with progress

This example uses reqwest and indicatif to upload binary data to a server with progress. Building the project will result in two binaries, one for the client and one for the server.

# Build and Run

Build the binaries with cargo

`cargo build`

Run the server

```bash
$ ./target/debug/upload-server

Server running on 0.0.0.0:3030 ðŸš€
```

Run the client on a decent sized file and watch the progress bar cruise.

```bash
./target/debug/upload-client upload ~/Downloads/archive.zip
```
